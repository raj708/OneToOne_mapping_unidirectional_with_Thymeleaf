# OneToOne_mapping_with_Thymeleaf(unidirectional)
## Introduction
OneToOneMappingUnidirectional is a simple Spring Boot project that demonstrates one-to-one mapping between two entities in an unidirectional manner. In this project, we have two entities, Person and Address, where each person has only one address. The application uses Thymeleaf as the templating engine to display user and address details on a web page.
